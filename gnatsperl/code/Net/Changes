Revision history for Perl extension Net::Gnats.

0.06

Gnats.pm
- Added 'Net::Gnats::updatePR' method so multiple fields can be changed
  with one call instead of having to call replaceField multiple times.
- Added 'Net::Gnats::newPR' method.
- Added 'Net::Gnats::filloutPR' method which fills out a new PR with the
  field defaults specified in the gnats dbconfig.
- Fixed checking for when gnatsd will return a multiline response.
  Previosuly all codes from 300-399 (except 350) where assumed to be
  multiline.  But the gnatsd spec says only 300-349 will be multiline.
- When PR's are unparsed into a string the MultiText fields are properly
  escaped.
- Added ability to turn on debugging with '$Net::Gnats:debugGnatsd = 1'
- Work around a bug in gnatsd where it doesn't properly close file handles,
  so gnatsperl closes and reopens the connection after 100 newPRs.  I've
  submitted a patch to gnats but it's not been incorporated yet. 
- Disabled the listClasses method since gnatsd does not support it
  anymore.
- Methods listFieldNames, listInitialInputFields, getFieldType,
  isValidField, getFieldTypeInfo, getFieldFlags, getFieldDefault, only
  query gnatsd once for the information so multiple calls to these methods
  are much faster.
- Net::Gnats:lockPR extracts the PR data and returns a Net::Gnats::PR
  object.
- Added Net::Gnats::checkPR method.  Changed checkNewPR method to call
  checkPR.
- Improved checking for "requireChangeReason" checking in replaceField
  method.
- submitPR method calls PR::unparse method.
- Split out some code in _doGnatsCmd into new '_readAndPrcessResponse'
  method so other methods could use the same code.


PR.pm
- Net::Gnats::PR::new method now requires the Net::Gnats object as the
  first argument.   This was done to provide better error checking.  The
  best was to fix existing code is to change any Net::Gnats::PR::new calls
  to $g->new().  See documentation.
- The PR number is no longer tracked differently inside PR.pm.  It's now
  treated like all other fields.  Users will not notice this change since
  the getNumber method still works like previous versions.  However if you
  were accessing the $pr->{number} data directly it won't work anymore.
- The setField method takes an optional argument which is the changeReason.
  - Currently setField does not require the changeReason to be specified,
    but this may change in the next release.
- Major change to methods that parse and unparse PR's.  A lot of code was
  copied from gnatsweb so gnatsperl now does a much better job of handling
  PR data.  Also, in the future this will allow us to handle gnatsweb style
  attachements.
